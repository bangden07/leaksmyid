Leaks.my.id is a collection of information data that we get randomly or from 3rd parties that are public or private. If we think the data is not worthy of publication, then we will not publish it. Because it is related to further considerations.

We get the data not from stealing, but we get it from your own negligence who intentionally or unintentionally publish and result in data that should be private, now becomes public consumption.
